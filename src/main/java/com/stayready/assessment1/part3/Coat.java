     * FIELDS
     *
     * A coat has three fields: price, size, and color.
     * Price and size are implemented in Garment so you
     * only need to add the color field.
     *
     * - create a field called "color" of type String

    /*
     * CONSTRUCTOR
     *
     * Create three constructors:
     * 1. an empty constructor which takes no params. Initialize
     *      price to 0 and size to "Universal", and color to "Black".
     *
     * 2. a constructor that takes a "price". Set the instance price field
     *      to the parameter field.
     *      Set the size to "Universal" and color to "Black".
     *
     * 3. a constructor that takes a price, size, and color.
     *     Set the params to the instance fields.
     *
     */


    /*
     * METHODS
     *
     * 1. Create a getter method called "String getColor" to return the color.
     *    The return type is String.
     *
     * 2. Create a setter method called "void setColor(String newColor)"
     *  which takes the color from the param and set it to the instance field.
     *
     * 3. Add a new method called "String getDescription()".
     *      It returns a String description of the object.
     *      It should be formatted like this:
     *      "This is a [size] [color] coat. It costs $[price]"
     *      Example: "This is a Large Green coat. It costs $19.99"
